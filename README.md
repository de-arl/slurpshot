# slurpshot
Screenshot script for sway with bemenu, native wayland

The script opens a bemenu that let's you choose the area for the screenshot to be taken. Afterwards you can view, open or discard the screenshot. You can also choose to print the screenshot with lpr with or without saving the screenshot. Make it executable and copy it to your PATH or execute it with ./slurpshot

You can easily edit it to change the screenshot directory, the viewer or anything else.

It depends on bemenu, grim, imv, jq and slurp

You may edit bemenu parameters in the script to make the design suite your setup. The menu can be easily enlarged setting the BEMENU_SCALE environment variable. (See man bemenu.)
